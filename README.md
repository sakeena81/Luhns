# Luhns
Luhns Algorithm implemented into C# functions

The algorithm I want to discuss here is called the Luhn Algorithm. It is also known as the mod 10 check. The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, but the most common use is credit card numbers. The algorithm was invented by an IBM scientist, Hans Peter Luhn. Hence the name given.
